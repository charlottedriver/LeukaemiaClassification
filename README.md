# LeukaemiaClassification

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model for the classification of cancer samples based on gene expression data. Specifically, the project aims to accurately classify samples into acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) categories. 

## Data
There are two datasets:
1. "data_set_ALL_AML_train" - the training sample (includes 38 samples in total)
2. "data_set_ALL_AML_independent" - the test sample (includes 34 samples in total)

Both datasets contain measurements corresponding to ALL and AML samples from bone marrow and peripheral blood.

# Classification of Leukemia by Gene Expression

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model for the classification of cancer samples based on gene expression data. Specifically, the project aims to accurately classify samples into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) categories. 

## Data
There are two datasets:
1. "data_set_ALL_AML_train" - the training sample (includes 38 samples in total)
2. "data_set_ALL_AML_independent" - the test sample (includes 34 samples in total)

Both datasets contain measurements corresponding to ALL and AML samples from bone marrow and peripheral blood.

## Acknowledgement
This dataset originates from a study conducted by Goulb et al. (1999) in which they used said data to classify the type of cancer in each patient by variation in gene expression.
